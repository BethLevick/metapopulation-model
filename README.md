# metapopulation-model
Burrow level metapopulation model of Y.pestis dynamics in R.opimus in Kazakhstan

setup.r organises the data and runs in the functions to run the model, i.e. converting data to occupied/empty from 5 classes
loading in distance matrix

All of the functions are in metapopulation-functions.r
These include data set up functions, functions to estimate parameters and functions to run the simulation

run-model.r allows for the estimation and simulation to be run
